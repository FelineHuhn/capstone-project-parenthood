# My Capstone Project: ParentHood

ParentHood is an app that lists spots that parents can visit with their children in their free time. A detailed description of each individual place shows whether a visit is worth. Own local "insider tips" can be shared with the community and favorite spots can be saved.


## Demo:

You can find the hosted version on [Vercel](https://parent-hood.vercel.app)

**Important the project is optimized for mobile screen.**
